OCR-Of-Bank-Statements

A Python-based application that integrates OCR and NLP technologies to extract relevant financial information from images stored in specific Cloudinary folders. 
The application preprocesses images, performs OCR using EasyOCR, and refines the extracted data with Cohere's NLP API. Results are presented in a user-friendly interface powered by Gradio.

Features

Cloudinary Integration: Fetch images from designated folders in your Cloudinary account (Salary, Profit, Bank Statements, etc.).
OCR Processing: Preprocess and analyze document images using EasyOCR for text extraction.
LLM Integration: Refine extracted text and extract specific financial data using Cohere's language model.
Financial Insights: Automatically extract key financial metrics like Basic Salary, Total Expenses, and Closing Balance.
User Interface: Interact with the application using a Gradio-based UI, which displays results in tables and includes image previews.
